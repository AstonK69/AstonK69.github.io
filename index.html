        <h1>What is Formula Student?</h1>
        <p>Formula Student (FS) is Europe's most established educational engineering competition and celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2023, tasking teams to design, build and race a single-seater race car.</p>
        <p>Backed by industry and high-profile engineers such as Ross Brawn OBE, the competition aims to develop enterprising and innovative young engineers and encourage more young people to take up a career in engineering, with over 100 university teams taking part every year.</p>
        <p>The project usually forms part of a degree-level project and is viewed by the motorsport industry as the standard for engineering graduates to meet, transitioning them from university to the workplace. It is a kite-mark for real-world engineering experience, combining practical engineering experience with soft skills including business planning and project management.</p>
